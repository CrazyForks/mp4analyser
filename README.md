# mp4analyser #
This project is a Python/TkInter application that can read and display the structure and contents of boxes 
(AKA atoms in Quick Time documentation) within mp4 files conforming to ISO/IEC 14496-12 – MPEG-4 Part 12.
It should work cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS)

# Prerequisites #
Use the latest version of Python (3.7+)

# Status #
In development, but should be usable.

## TODO: ##
* Add more iso boxes, aim for complete coverage of ISO/IEC 14496-12 – MPEG-4 Part 12.
* Add more non-iso boxes.
* Optimise and refine code.
