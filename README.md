# mp4analyser #
This project is a Python/TkInter application that can read and display the structure and contents of "boxes" 
(AKA "atoms" in Quick Time documentation) within mp4 files that conform to ISO/IEC 14496-12 â€“ MPEG-4 Part 12.

I believe the use of Python allows any technically-minded individual to add their own "box" definitions as required.

It should work on any platform that can run a Python interpreter and support TKinter.

# Prerequisites #
Use the latest version of Python (3.7+)

# Status #
In beta trial by you, "the great internet public".

## TODO: ##
* keep adding boxes.
* Optimise and refine code.
